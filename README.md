# In this project we create a class of a binary search tree that contains natural numbers.

<h1>Functionality:</h1> <br>

# How to use the tree:

## Insert - in order to insert number into its suitable place in the tree, just use the function insert(your number).
Note: if you insert existing number the function will throw an exception.

## Remove - in order to remove a number from the tree and keep it organized, just use the function remove(your number).
Note: if you remove aÂ  non existing number the function will throw an <b>exception</b>.

## Size - in order to get the amount of the numbers in the tree, just use the function size().

## Contains - in order to know if a number is in the tree, just use the function contains(your_number).

## Root - in order to get the value of the root, just use the function root().
Note: if the tree is empty the function will throw an exception.

## Neighbors - in order to find who is the neighbors of some number that in the tree, just use the functions parent(your_number), left(your_number), right(your_number).
Note: if there is no neighbor as you ask for, the function will throw an exception.

## Print - in order to print the tree, just use the function print().
